# Game-Dev - a Visual Novel for ESL Teaching
The purpose of this game is to enhance willingness to communicate in high school students in a playful matter.
I created this game with Python in Ren'Py, which is a popular tool for makinbg visual novels. I introduced it to my students and taught them the basics of code writing.
Since the game has at least 8 outcomes, each path required a different label and two choices.
